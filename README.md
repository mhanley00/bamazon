Welcome to Bamazon! 

Bamazon is a faux e-commerce site that lives on the command line. With the Chicago Marathon coming up, I've got running and iconic herutage brand Tracksmith on the brain, so the mock store is filled with Tracksmith merch. 

To see Bamazon in action:

1. Run "npm install" from the command line.
2. Create and fill the MySQL database on your machine by running "mysql -u root" and then "source schema-seeds.sql" (for Mac).
3. Run "node bamazonCustomer.js" to shop the store!

You'll see Bamazon's exclusive selection of Tracksmith merch and be able to "purchase" any of the items in stock by entering the item id and quantity. Snag them up before they're gone! You look faster already.


Bamazon is powered by MySQL, Express, and Inquirer. Read more about them and their npm packages here:
